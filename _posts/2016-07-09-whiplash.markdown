This film is something that any serious band member can relate to at a degree. 

From the beginning, Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons), the psychotic, dictatorial conductor drives and tortures Andrew (Miles Teller), his introverted, success-obsessed drummer student. Before starting at the American top music school, Andrew was a sort-of-a normal dude who could gather up courage to ask a girl out and engage in familiar talks with family on the future of a musical career.

Fletcher, however, immediately starts implementing his tyrannical and violent tactics against his students - especially towards Andrew.

And this gets at him - he ends his awkward relationship with the girl and enters an unhealthy phase of extreme introversion and gory drumming.

He even comes out of a serious car accident to run to his concert covered in blood to play his hard-earned solo part. But of course, he isn't able to play well on stage, since his head was frickin bleeding everywhere.

After this incident, Andrew is dropped out. He abandons all hope of achieving the dream of becoming one of the greatest. He and his family anonymously reports Fletcher for his extreme tactics, which gets Fletcher fired.

Then, they of course coincidentally meet at a local jazz performance, and Fletcher delivers us with a predictable and obvious reasoning of his methods. Furthermore, he suggests to Andrew that Fletcher needs a drummer who is familiar with Caravan (the piece Andrew poured his blood into) and of course Andrew agrees to play on stage with his local band. By this point, we feel that they are now and will be on friendly terms from now on.

If the movie ended with a smooth performance like that, I would not have put my injured index finger into use of writing this post. This movie has one of the best endings I have seen.

Fletcher totally baits Andrew just before the start of the performance by conducting an entirely unexpected piece. And Andrew is slowly forced to move out of the stage as the audience recognizes his incapability. His dad rushes to the backstage to hug him out, when he returns to stage and turns the table on Fletcher by playing Caravan!!! He cues everyone in naturally and plays the 9 minute piece beautifully from start to end with Fletcher making approving remarks.

>good job

Why this ending is so intense is not only because of his electrocuting solo but also because it leaves every watcher with an uneasy feeling when Fletcher mouths "good job" before the ending note, trying to approve of all the physical and psychological sacrifices he made to achieve this beautiful climax. It also leaves every musician out there with a thought whether they would personally put themselves through this to become one of the greatests. But really, this film still left me approving of Fletcher's tactic that would even sacrifice hundreds of student lives to create the next Charlie Parker.

Here is the historic final performance of the piece:
