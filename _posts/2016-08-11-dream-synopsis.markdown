There were once a boy and a girl who lived in the dark. The boy and the girl would be sad and would sometimes even cry on the street, for this was a time - long, long ago - when both boys and girls could cry on the street. Seeing their plight in the darkness, God said, "Let there be light," and there was light, and by Providence they were brought together to show all others the magic. It was an unavowed secret that the Universe existed just for their love. Once together, the boy and the girl were both happy for they made each other happy all the time. They would climb hills while holding hands, and eat fruits and plant flowers, and when they felt what people so often feel in their stomachs they would plant soft kisses in quick succession on each other's faces. They lived so gloriously that there was no glory left in even a noble death.

Yet as things go in dealings with the hearts of men, times changed, and you came into a world where your brothers and sisters had turned their backs on love. Life went by too fast for them; always numb, always blurry. You could have ran - lived your life as God first intended, making love and being loved - but of course you didn't run. You are your brother's brother, and nothing can change that, or make you forget.  
After shedding many tears for the ocassion, there you were, face to face, facing your brothers and sisters in the battlefield. With your army of love behind you, just as the horn blew and the war began, in what can only happen in a dream of a dream, you lay down your arms. And all the women and all the children and all the men behind you - warriors, whose strength is not to fight - lay down their arms and we all ran together, as one, to our brothers and sisters and we all saw each other's naked hearts beating the same, and in place of lives only ignorance was lost, and there was nothing left to discover, nothing left to conquor, and we all sang and danced. And just as the final sword was dropped, rain fell from the heavens for all the gods were crying from having witnessed the unthinkable revolution, and all the people were at once freed by water. Nature bowed for we had overcome evolution: and in this final declamation, not God, but Man said, "Let there be love," and there was love.

You wake up now and suddenly the truth is no longer shy: all your dreams are actually other people's dreams but even that is okay, because you can still love. You wake up and you're at the beach, waiting to be freed by water. You realize you don't want to fight it anymore: humility soars through your veins. Is the Earth yours? Are the oceans yours? Is even a fallen leaf yours? You're just a boy, or maybe you're a girl, and only your mother is yours. You wake up now and your lonely eyes open - the sun shines just for you as you make sandcastles with amma, and you're finally freed by water, forever. You wake up and the picture stops - this is your happy ending. You wake up now and your life starts - this is your happy...
