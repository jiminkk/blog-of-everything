<p>we love this song!! the title itself, ‘piledriver waltz’, captures so much. piledriver is this noisy drilling machine and waltz is such an elegant dance. the contradiction encapulates what love is like, with its nice parts and its not so nice ones :^)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I etched the face of a stopwatch<br />
On the back of a raindrop<br />
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass</p>
</blockquote>

<p>we’re not entirely sure what this means but we interpret it as being about him capturing a particular moment in time - a timestamp on a stopwatch, a falling raindrop mid-air and sand sinking in an hourglass stopped still. quite nice c:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I heard an unhappy ending<br />
It sort of sounds like you leaving<br />
I heard the piledriver waltz<br />
It woke me up this morning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>first two lines are so sweet :c he woke up to a bad dream of her leaving</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You look like you’ve been for breakfast at the Heartbreak Hotel<br />
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets and the literature on how to lose<br />
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food<br />
If you’re gonna try and walk on water make sure you wear your comfortable shoes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>musically, this is lemur’s favorite part of the song! Elvis reference + such smooth beats throughout &lt; 3<br />
we think he’s talking about her having had a bad experience in the past (been to the heartbreak hotel, waitress, food were miserable - inuendoes about the bad experience with old partner and poor sex, perhaps), so this time she’s taking the high road. this time she wore her comfortable shoes (didn’t get too attached).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mysteries flashing amber go green<br />
When you answer but the red on the rest<br />
Of the questionnaire never changes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>he’s very confused about what’s bothering her. he’s got these questions in his head but she doesn’t give him a straight answer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I heard the news that you’re planning<br />
To shoot me out of a cannon<br />
I heard the piledriver waltz<br />
It woke me up this morning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>now he thinks she’s going to leave him &lt;/3 aw he had a nightmare :c</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You look like you’ve been for breakfast at the Heartbreak Hotel<br />
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets and the literature on how to lose<br />
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food<br />
If you’re gonna try and walk on water make sure you wear your comfortable shoes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>beautiful tune ensues…<br />
what a great song, yay C:</p>
